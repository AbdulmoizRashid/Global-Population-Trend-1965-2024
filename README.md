# 🌍 World Population Growth Analysis – Data Analyst Project

## 📝 Executive Summary
This project analyzes global population trends from **1965 to 2024** using Python.  
The dataset includes country-level population data across decades, with metadata such as country name, country code, indicator name, and indicator code.

The goal was to understand how fast the world population has grown, how growth rates have changed over time, and which countries have scaled most significantly.

## ❓ Business Problem
Global population growth has major implications for resource planning, urban development, and policy-making.

**Key question**:  
*"How has the world population evolved over time, and which regions have experienced the fastest growth?"*

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Overview & Cleaning
- Filled missing values using **median imputation** with `lambda` functions  
- Reshaped wide-format year columns into long-format using `melt()`

### Trend Analysis
- Visualized overall population growth across years  
- Grouped years into decades to calculate and compare growth rates

### Country-Level Comparison
- Identified top countries by population growth  
- Compared regional and income-based trends using **line and bar charts**

---

## 🛠️ Skills and Tools Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Data Wrangling**: melt, groupby, lambda functions  
- **Analytical Thinking**: trend detection, growth rate calculation  
- **Storytelling**: visual comparison across time and geography

---

## 📈 Results
- World population has grown steadily from ~3 billion to over 8 billion between 1965 and 2024  
- Growth rate accelerated in recent decades, especially in **middle-income** and **East Asian** regions  
- Top populous countries show distinct scaling patterns, with some regions plateauing while others continue to rise

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Use these insights to inform **urban planning**, **resource allocation**, and **policy development**  
- Monitor growth trends in **emerging economies** for future infrastructure needs  
- Consider **demographic dividend zones** for investment and development strategy
